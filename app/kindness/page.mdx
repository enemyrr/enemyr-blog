Being Kind

I hate bullying. I really do. It's the weakest form of human behavior. Tearing someone down to make yourself feel taller is a bug in the human operating system that we really should have patched by now.

### The Misconception of Anger
We've all dealt with people who are rude, short-tempered, or just plain mean. It's easy to take it personally. It's easy to fire back.

But here's the thing I try to remember: **If someone is mad, they're probably just having a bad day.**

It's rarely about you. You might just be the NPC they interacted with when their stress bar was full. Maybe they got bad news. Maybe they're insecure. Maybe they're just tired.

### Kindness as a Default
Being kind when everything is going well is easy. Being kind when someone is screaming at you? That's a skill. That's discipline.

You don't have to be a doormat. You can set boundaries. But you can do it without adding more hate to the equation.

Be the person who breaks the cycle. It costs nothing, but the ROI is infinite.
