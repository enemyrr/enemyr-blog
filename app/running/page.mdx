# Running

I'm not exactly a pro, but I run a bit. It’s my way of clearing my head when I’m not stuck behind a screen or in a meeting. 

I've gotten into long-distance running and now tackle both half marathons and full marathons. Next up on the list is **Copenhagen 2026**, where I'm aiming for a sub 3-hour finish. I recently discovered that the faster you run, the faster you are done.

You can follow my training (and see if I actually make it to Copenhagen) on [Strava](https://strava.app.link/NFXkttWzhZb). 🏃‍♂️
