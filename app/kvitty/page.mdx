# Kvitty

[Kvitty](https://www.kvitty.se) is a dead simple bookkeeping system built by [sajn](/sajn). When Bokio became prohibitively expensive, we built the tool we actually needed: straightforward bookkeeping that doesn't break the bank.

### Two Modes, One App

Kvitty offers two modes to fit your business needs:

**Traditional Bookkeeping**
- Full double-entry bookkeeping with BAS chart of accounts support
- Create vouchers, manage general ledger, and get complete financial overview
- SIE export for accountants

**Receipt Management**
- Simple matching between bank transactions and receipts
- Upload receipt photos directly in the app
- Automatic categorization
- Export supporting documents

### Pricing That Makes Sense

- **Free:** Receipt management, unlimited vouchers, unlimited storage, team members
- **49 SEK/month:** Full traditional bookkeeping + receipt management
- **Self-hosted:** Free, open source (MIT license), full control

No hidden fees. No surprises. Just bookkeeping that works.

Since Bokio's pricing went through the roof, Kvitty fills the gap for small businesses who need reliable bookkeeping without the enterprise price tag. It's open source, so you can self-host if you want full control, or use the hosted version for convenience.
