# Sales for Engineers

I used to think sales was just for people in suits trying to trick you into buying things you don't need. Then I became a real estate agent and realized that sales is actually about **empathy**.

Engineers often fall into the trap of thinking the product should sell itself. "If the code is good enough, they will come." Spoiler: they won't.

### Solving, Not Selling
The best sales process feels like debugging. You're trying to find the root cause of a user's pain and offer a patch. If your product fixes their bug, the sale happens naturally.

### The Engineer's Advantage
We are trained to understand systems and logic. Use that.
- **Understand the problem:** Don't pitch features. Ask questions until you understand the bottleneck.
- **Propose a solution:** Show how your tool fits into their stack.
- **Handle edge cases:** Objections are just edge cases in the user's decision logic. Handle them gracefully.

You don't need to be loud to sell. You just need to be helpful.
