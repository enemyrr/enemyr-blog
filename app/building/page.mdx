# Iterative Building

"Perfect" is the enemy of "Done".

I see so many builders get stuck in the planning phase. They want the architecture to be flawless, the design to be pixel-perfect, and the database schema to be future-proof for the next 10 years.

By the time they launch, the market has moved on.

### Ship to Learn
You don't actually know what you're building until users touch it.
- **Build:** Create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Not "Minimum Broken Product", but the smallest thing that delivers value.
- **Ship:** Get it live. Localhost doesn't count.
- **Iterate:** Listen to feedback. Fix bugs. Add features that people actually ask for.

### The Loop
I've learned more from shipping broken code and fixing it in production than I ever did from reading documentation. The fear of breaking things keeps you stagnant.

Break things. Fix them. That's how you grow. That's how software gets built.
