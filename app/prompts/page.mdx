Writing a Good Prompt

Prompting is the new coding. The logic is the same: garbage in, garbage out. If you give an LLM a vague instruction, don't be surprised when you get a generic result.

Context is king. Treat the AI like a brilliant junior developer who doesn't know your codebase or your preferences.

### The Bad Way
This is what most people do, and why they think AI is "meh".

```text
Write code for a button.
```

**Result:** You'll get a generic HTML button, or maybe a React component if you're lucky. No styling, no props, no context.

### The Good Way
Be specific. Define the constraints, the tech stack, and the edge cases.

```text
Create a reusable Button component for a Next.js 14 app using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

Requirements:
- Variants: 'default', 'destructive', 'outline', 'secondary', 'ghost', 'link'.
- Sizes: 'default', 'sm', 'lg', 'icon'.
- Props: Extend React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>.
- State: Add an 'isLoading' prop that disables the button and shows a spinner icon (lucide-react).
- Usage: It should be accessible and use forwardRef.

Style it to match a clean, minimal aesthetic (shadcn/ui style).
```

**Result:** You get a production-ready component that you can drop straight into your project.

### The Mental Model
Think of a prompt as a function definition.
- **Parameters:** What inputs are you providing? (Code snippets, error logs).
- **Body:** What transformation do you want? (Fix, refactor, explain).
- **Return Type:** What format do you want? (JSON, Markdown, Python code).

Stop guessing. Start specifying.
