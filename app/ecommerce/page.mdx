# Headless Commerce

Monolithic e-commerce platforms are safe, but they're also cages. You get the features they give you, the performance they allow, and the frontend they dictate.

**Headless commerce** breaks those chains. It decouples the frontend (the "head") from the backend business logic.

### Why I Like It
I want the freedom to build a frontend that feels instant. I want to use **Next.js** for the experience, **Framer Motion** for the feel, and **Tailwind** for the style. But I don't want to build a cart system, inventory management, or payment gateway from scratch. That's suicide.

### The Stack
My go-to stack for modern e-commerce:

1.  **Shopify (Backend):** They handle the hard stuff. Inventory, PCI compliance, taxes, checkout.
2.  **Next.js (Frontend):** Server-side rendering, image optimization, edge caching.
3.  **Sanity (CMS):** For rich storytelling that product descriptions can't handle.

It's more work to set up than a basic theme, but the control you get is absolute. You're building a software product, not just a store.
