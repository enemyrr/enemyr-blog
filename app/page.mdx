I'm a [developer and product designer](/bio). I work at [sajn](/sajn) as product lead. Previously, I founded [RIBBAN](/ribban) and served as CEO. I've been building products for over 10 years and still love the process of starting from zero.

Like everyone else, I’m into [AI](/ai) and how it's reshaping how we build products. When I’m not in front of a screen, I’m probably out [running](/running) — currently training for the Copenhagen Marathon 2026.

Some things I think are important:
- [Sales for Engineers](/sales)
- [Writing a Good Prompt](/prompts)
- [Headless Commerce](/ecommerce)
- [Being Kind](/kindness)
- [Iterative Building](/building)
- [Endurance & Discipline](/running)

Projects:
- [sajn](/sajn) — Digital signing platform
- [Kvitty](/kvitty) — Dead simple bookkeeping
- [groq-zsh](http://github.com/enemyrr/groq-zsh) — Zsh plugins for AI-powered command generation
- [RIBBAN](/ribban) — Previously founded
