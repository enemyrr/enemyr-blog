# Andreas Enemyr

I'm a [developer and product designer](/bio). I work at [sajn](/sajn) as project lead. Previously, I founded [RIBBAN](/ribban) and served as CEO. I've been building products for over a decade and still love the process of starting from zero.

Like everyone else, I’m into [AI](/ai) and how it's reshaping how we build products. When I’m not in front of a screen, I’m probably out [running](/running) — currently training for the Copenhagen Marathon 2026.

Some things I think are important:

- [Sales for Engineers](/sales)
- [Writing a Good Prompt](/prompts)
- [Headless Commerce](/ecommerce)
- [Being Kind](/kindness)
- [Iterative Building](/building)
- [Endurance & Discipline](/running)

You can [se what I’m up to](https://github.com/enemyrr) or [follow me online](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasenemyr/). I also advise companies and always up for a chat. [Reach out](mailto:andreas@enemyr.com) if interested.
