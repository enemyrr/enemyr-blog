Hi, I'm Andreas,
a 25-year-old guy based in Stockholm. My journey has been a mix of sales and development — or whatever you call it when you start by hacking around on Minecraft as a kid and end up building startups.

### Work & Education

### Development & Startups
I've been into tech since the early days. That curiosity led me to start my first company in 2020 (RIBBAN), and most recently, my second one in 2025 (sajn). I love the process of building things from scratch and seeing where they can go.

### Sales & Real Estate
I’ve always wanted to be better at sales. I figured, what’s harder to sell than a house? So, I decided to go all in. I took a Bachelor's degree in Real Estate Economics from KAU and became a licensed real estate agent. I spent a few years at Fastighetsbyrån (2020-2022) learning the ropes of high-stakes negotiation and sales.

Today, I combine those two worlds — the technical building and the strategic selling — in everything I do.
