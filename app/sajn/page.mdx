sajn

[sajn](https://www.sajn.se) is a Stockholm-based digital signing platform I co-founded in early 2025. We're building the tool I always wished I had: a signing experience that's actually fast, secure, and doesn't feel like it was designed in 1998.

As **Product Lead**, I oversee the strategic direction and day-to-day development of the platform. We're ditching the "print-scan-email" era for a workflow that actually respects your time: Create. Send. sajn.

### The Core Product
- **BankID by Default:** We believe security is a right, not a premium feature. That's why BankID signing is included in all our paid plans.
- **AI-Driven Workflows:** We use AI to help users draft contracts in seconds, ensuring they get the legals right without the headache.
- **Precision & Speed:** Designed for modern teams, the platform offers real-time status tracking, automated reminders, and 99.998% uptime.
- **Battle-Tested Reliability:** Since launch, we've maintained a perfect record: zero data loss and zero document failures in production.
- **Social Mission:** For every active subscription, we donate 1 SEK monthly to [Friends](https://friends.se) to support their work against bullying.

We're currently scaling fast and constantly shipping new features. If you're tired of legacy signing tools that slow you down, come see what we're building.
